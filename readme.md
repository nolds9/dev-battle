# Dev Battle

Arbitrarily determine winners and losers between github users

## Setup

- Clone down repo
- `cd` into repo
- `npm install` to load dependencies
- Start app locally with `npm start`
- Navigate in browser to `http://localhost:8080` to interact with app

### Notes

App uses Github API to query player info.
By default users do not need to register an application, but if you hit the rate limit, you'll need to register an application and include your own api key and secret.
